This program has two classes: BinaryTree and BTree
It also has one interface: TreeStructure

BinaryTree runs a program to create a binary tree using multiple implemented methods
from the TreeStructure class including insert, remove, get, findMaxDepth, and findMinDepth. 
BTree also does this but for a btree. Insert inserts a value into the tree and notes what
time it was inserted at, remove removes a value, get gets the time a value was inserted at,
findMaxDepth finds the max depth of the tree, findMinDepth finds the min depth of the tree.
